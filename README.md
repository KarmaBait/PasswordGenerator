# PasswordGenerator
Creates a random password including all kind of characters. Lets you select length and will save the generated password in a .txt file for you.

Once you run the script it'll create a directory named "logs" wherever the Generator.py file is saved.
You'll be asked to select the length of your password. Make sure to use numbers only! Letters & special characters etc., will not work!
Using "0" as number will not make any sense as it'll simply create a password with 0 characters.

Once done, you'll be asked to select a name for the file that the password will be saved in.
### IMPORTANT: If you select a name that is already in use for a .txt file in your "logs" directory, it'll overwrite the old file without any chance of return! ###

The password will then be saved within your "logs" directory. The generator will also create and overwrite a "latest.txt", including the last password generated.



Setup:
Simply download the .py file and move it into a folder of your choice.

Open your cmd within the folder and type: "python Generator.py" (or whatever you rename the .py file to).
Now you're able to navigate through the terminal by following what you're told.
